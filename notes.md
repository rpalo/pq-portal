# Notes and reminders

**2/17/17**
I had a thought about a possible cool feature.  It might be good to setup specific workflows that would take a person through the entire process of something.  We'll see.  Just getting started up today where I left off.

- [x] Once I'm done with the first RMA view, I can make a rudimentary quality main page with links.

- [x] Eventually, the base templates could use namespaced so I can share them around.

Got a rudimentary view of the RMA finished.  Also updated the admin to show RMA.  Noted a few follow up tasks.

- [ ] Apparently `id` is a reserved keyword in Python.  I need to go refactor that out of the rest of the app.

- [x] I need to reorganize so that I get consistent styling accross the app.

- [ ] Now that I can list and delete RMAs, I need to make a RMA form so that I can add/change them.  Hopefully I can build off of the inventory's current infrastructure.

I finished making a rough quality main page.  Next step is to get the RMA form done.

- [ ] RMA form

Finished Quality app setup.  Going to try and make sure it's working and commit.  The next step is to get the first round of models planned out and going.

- [x] Next up is to get a layout down for the RMA model so I can make sure everything is good.  Once that is complete, I can move into the rest of the models.  NCMR, CAR, and Problems are my main focus.
