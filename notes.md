# Notes and reminders

**2/10/17**

Finished Quality app setup.  Going to try and make sure it's working and commit.  The next step is to get the first round of models planned out and going.

- [] Next up is to get a layout down for the RMA model so I can make sure everything is good.  Once that is complete, I can move into the rest of the models.  NCMR, CAR, and Problems are my main focus.
